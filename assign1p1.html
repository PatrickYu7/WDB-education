      Naruto Uzumaki (Japanese: うずまき ナルト, Hepburn: Uzumaki Naruto)
      (/ˈnɑːrətoʊ/) is the titular protagonist of the manga Naruto, created by
      Masashi Kishimoto. As the series progresses, he is a young ninja from the
      fictional village of Konohagakure (Hidden Leaf Village). The villagers
      ridicule and ostracize Naruto on account of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox—a
      malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure—that was sealed away in
      Naruto's body. Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader,
      the Hokage, in order to receive their approval. His carefree, optimistic,
      and boisterous personality enables him to befriend other Konohagakure
      ninja, as well as a ninja from other villages. Naruto appears in the
      series' films and in other media related to the franchise, including video
      games and original video animations (OVA), as well as the sequel Boruto:
      Naruto Next Generations by Ukyō Kodachi, where he is the Hokage, and his
      son, Boruto Uzumaki, is the protagonist.

    <h2>Creation and Coneption</h2>
    <h4>Original Conept and Influences</h4>
    <p>
      During the 1990s, new manga author Masashi Kishimoto sought to write a
      one-shot chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version
      never made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child
      who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the
      summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump magazine based on the idea.[1] When
      comparing both the Naruto one-shot and his other work, Karakuri, Kishimoto
      realized that former's title character was more appealing than the lead of
      Karakuri. Kishimoto reflects Naruto's "honest" smile was well received in
      contrast to the sly look the main character from Karakuri had. Following
      the success of another one-shot, Mario, Kishimoto started working on the
      Naruto series where he wanted to reuse the title character from his
      earlier one-shot. Kishimoto wrote the first two chapters to show his
      appeal to the readers and then focus on the other protagonists despite
      difficulties. Following the second chapter, Kishimoto introduced the other
      protagonists but as bad relationships including with Sasuke Uchiha and
      Naruto's constant reject crushes at Sakura Haruno. The manga story was
      planned to show Naruto's coming-of-age through multiple fights and looked
      forward to seeing the conclusion.[2]

    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>
      After fans likened Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura to the three main characters
      from Harry Potter fantasy books, Kishimoto noted that both trios began
      their careers in a classroom, though he added that the similarity was
      unintentional.[7] During the series' publication, Kishimoto married and
      had children. This influenced how he viewed Naruto's character. Naruto met
      his parents, and learned of their sacrifices in order to help him to
      control the Fox inside him so that he could protect their world. As a
      result, Naruto appreciated his life more and learned that his parents
      loved him, something the author wanted the character to feel based on his
      own experience as a father.[8] In the first chapters of the series,
      Kishimoto did not conceive the idea that Naruto would be the son of Minato
      Namikaze. However, as time passed on, the manga author made touches to
      Minato's face shown in the Hokage Mountain in Konoha to make them more
      similar to Naruto with an emphasis on their spiky hairs. However, in order
      to reduce too many similarities, Kushina Uzumaki's character was made to
      look like Naruto's face.
